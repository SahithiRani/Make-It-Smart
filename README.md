# Make It Smart
Make It Smart is a game developed with the help of Unity software. This game helps in
spreading awareness about smart cities and their importance in a fun way. It can also be used to teach
students what exactly are smart cities and what makes them different from normal cities. This project
was developed as a part of the Ecology and Environment Course and aims to spread the importance of
smart cities among people in a more fun and easier way.
